#
# AUTHOR:  Roberto Piscitello <robepisc@freemail.it>
# VERSION: 1.1
# LICENSE: public domain
# DEPENDENCIES: Nautilus, nautilus-error-dialog | gdialog | xmessage, gzip
# CHANGES:
#   v1.1: 17 Mar 2002
#     * made public domain (no more GPL)
#     * removed beep stuff, since it doesn't seem to work
#     * added nautilus-error-dialog support
#     * use "which" to avoid hardcoded paths (as suggested by Dylan Griffiths)
#   v1.0: 21 May 2001
#     * first public release
# INSTALL NOTES:
#   * open a Nautilus window and select, from the menu, File->Script->Open Scripts directory.
#   * copy this file in that directory.
#   * right-click on the copied file and open the Properties window.
#   * from the first tab: (if you want) change its icon (I suggest
#     "/usr/share/pixmaps/nautilus/gnome-compressed.png") and name.
#   * from the third tab: give executable permissions to the file owner.
