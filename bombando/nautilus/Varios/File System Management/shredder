# Please note* that `shred' relies on a very important assumption:
# that the filesystem overwrites data in place.Â  This is the traditional
# way to do things, but many modern filesystem designs do not satisfy
# this assumption.
#
# Exceptions exist, and are noted in shred's info manual. 
# Type 'info shred' from a prompt to see the list.
