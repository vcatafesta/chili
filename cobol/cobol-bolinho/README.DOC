This file contains supplemental information for the use
of the Microsoft COBOL Compiler Version 2.20.

1) Single user and networked ISAM

    This diskette contains two versions of ISAM. 

    One version, ISAM.EXE, is version 2.41, and should be
    used if you have a stand-alone, or non-IBM PC environment.
    If it is used in a network environment, locking affects the
    entire file instead of a single record.  It will allow ISAM
    files OPENed for INPUT to be read simultaneously by
    different processes, however.  There are also some speed im-
    provements over ISAM.EXE version 2.26.  This version of ISAM
    will support MS-NET compatible networks as well as the 
    IBM PC-NET.

    The second version of ISAM is designed to be used in an IBM
    PC-NET network environment and requires PC-DOS v 3.1 or
    greater.  It consists of three files: NISAM.EXE, ISAM.SRV,
    and ISAM.RDR.
    
    NISAM.EXE is the front end ISAM command processor, version 
    3.11.  The commands it accepts are:

    NISAM START SRV | RDR {/S:NNNNN}  --start network ISAM
                                     (/S: specifies buffer size)
    NISAM STOP                        --stop ISAM & free memory
    NISAM SHARE                       --show share list, as with
                                        server
    NISAM SHARE shortname=d:\path     --share a directory with
                                        the specified shortname
    NISAM SHARE d:\path               --share the specified
                                        directory
    NISAM SHARE shortname|d:\path /D  --stop sharing the short-
                                        name or directory
    NISAM FILE                        --show the currently OPEN
                                        ISAM files
    NISAM CLOSE name                  --close the specified open
                                        file

    ISAM.SRV is the server version of ISAM which can service 
    ISAM requests.  It is activated by the NISAM START SRV 
    command.  This command should be given on a network
    server machine when requests for ISAM files located on that
    machine will be made either locally or across the network.
    
    ISAM.RDR is the redirector version of ISAM, and is activated
    by the NISAM START RDR command.  This command should be 
    given on network machines that run programs that access ISAM
    files located only on other, server machines.
    
    Thus, ISAM files must be located on a server, and the ISAM
    on that machine must be activated with the NISAM START SRV
    command.
    
    Note:  It is possible, in the same network, to have some 
    machines running ISAM.EXE and others running NISAM.EXE.
    We do not recommend it, however.  It is NOT possible to
    have the same machine running both ISAM.EXE and NISAM.EXE
    at the same time.

    Like the network server, network directory paths must be
    shared using the NISAM SHARE command.  The command syntax
    has been modeled after the NET SHARE command.  You MUST
    NISAM SHARE the same directories that you NET SHARE, using
    the SAME syntax used in the NET SHARE command.
    For example, on a server named ZEKE you would type:

    NET SHARE PAYABLE=C:\LEDGER\PAYABLE
    NISAM SHARE PAYABLE=C:\LEDGER\PAYABLE

    Then, the user on another machine who wants to use an ISAM
    file in the C:\LEDGER\PAYABLE directory on the server named
    ZEKE would type:

    NET USE E: \\ZEKE\PAYABLE

    and then run the application which OPENs the ISAM file on 
    drive E:.

    The application can be passed the name of the machine\short-
    name to do an explicit OPEN using the "VALUE OF FILE-ID"
    clause.  For example:

    VALUE OF FILE-ID "\\ZEKE\PAYABLE\MASTER.DAT".

2) There is a limit of 10 alternate keys per ISAM file.

3)  Some users who have complex systems, with several layers of
    nested CALLs, for example, may run out of stack space.  This
    condition results in an "Out of Memory" error at runtime.
    The COBOL runtime can be configured to use additional
    stack space by adding the "/ST" switch to the LINK step in the
    "makerun.bat" batch file.  The default stack size is 2048 bytes.
    A recommended setting would be /ST:3072.  For example, a 
    modified LINK statement which increased the stack size to 3072
    bytes would be:

    link /st:3072 cobol asm %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 %1,,cobol1 cobol2/NOD

4)  CobRef: Cross reference utility

    CobRef is the cross reference generator included with version 2.20
    of Microsoft COBOL.  

    - When invoking CobRef, it should be noted that spaces are NOT
      allowed in the switches area.  In the following example,  note that
      there are NO spaces between the filename and the switch.
    
          COBREF filename/N
    
    - Users should note that variables defined in 
      COPY files will have an asterisk ('*') immediately following
      the line number in the CobRef listing.
