CHAPTER  6     DATA DIVISION

         6.2   Record Description Entry

         6.2.5 Numeric Items
             
               3. Binary Item

      Warning: Regardless of the number of digits
               specified in the PICTURE clause for
               a COMP-0 or COMP-4 item, truncation
               and the SIZE ERROR condition occur 
               only when a value moved to such an
               item exceeds the range (described
               above) for a 2-byte (COMP-0) or 4-
               byte (COMP-4) SIGNED binary integer.
               A COMP-0 item has an implicit PICTURE
               S9(5), and a COMP-4 item has an 
               implicit PICTURE S9(10).
 
               Binary items are always considered
               to be signed, even if the PICTURE 
               omits the sign character S.

        7.2    Arithmetic Statements

        7.2.1  SIZE ERROR Option

      Warning: For binary items, defined with 
               USAGE COMP-0 or COMP-4, truncation
               and the SIZE ERROR condition occur 
               only when a value moved to such an 
               item exceeds the range for a 2-byte
               (COMP-0) or 4-byte (COMP-4) SIGNED 
               binary integer. A COMP-0 item has 
               an implicit PICTURE S9(5), and a 
               COMP-4 item has an implicit PICTURE
               S9(10), regardless of the number of
               digits specified in the PICTURE
               clause.

Corrections To the Manual

Page   Correction

179    The example on page 179 is incorrect.  UNIT-PRICE OF ITEM-A
       will not ADD CORESPONDING to UNIT-PRICE OF ITEM-B because they
       do not have the same group qualifiers. 

239    The example of the INSPECT statement is incorrect.  The example
       makes use of the word "DELIMITER".  This is a reserved word
       in COBOL and will generate compile time errors.  To correct the
       example, change "DELIMITER" to "NEW-DELIMITER" and the example
       will work correctly.

250    This page contains an example of PERFORM... VARYING.  In the
       next to the last line of the example, the "VARYING" after the
       "AFTER" should be removed.  Otherwise the example will give
       a syntax error at compile time.

375    The SORT example starting on this page is in error.  The 
       following two lines need to be changed:

       Line 125 should be "READ INPUT-FILE NEXT RECORD INTO INPUT-RECORD"
       Line 158 should be "RETURN SORT-FILE RECORD INTO OUTPUT-RECORD"
