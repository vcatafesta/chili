About
-----


This is a fork of PyQode, which is now developed as the editor component for Rapunzel_ and OpenSesame_. The original PyQode repository (<= v2) is no longer maintained.

**pyqode.core** is the core framework of the `pyQode` project.

It contains the base classes and a set of extensions (modes/panels/managers)
needed to develop a specialised code editor.

It also provides a basic generic code editor that you can use as a fallback
when there is no specialised editor for a given language.
