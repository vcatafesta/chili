# Example of usage, first declare variable, after call function:
# YayPkgName="gimp" getYayInfoByPkgName
# By default use this functions only generate variables and arrays
# Nothing is printed on screen
# See in the end of file an example of usage like this:
# TestYayInfoByPkgName=true PkgName=firefox ./search_yay.sh

# Declare an associative array to hold package search results
declare -A SearchYay

# declare -a SearchYayIndex
