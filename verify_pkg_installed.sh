# Example of usage, first declare variable, after call function:
# nativePackage="gimp" verifyNativePackageInstalled
# If installed, AppstreamPackageInstalled return value is true
function verifyNativePackageInstalled {

		NativePackageInstalled=true

# Another example of possible commands to filter installed:
# PacmanInstalledList="$(LANGUAGE=C pacman -Qq)"
# Show only name os packages in $CommandOutput
# CommandOutputOnlyPackages="$(echo "$CommandOutput" | sed -E 's/^[[:graph:]]*\/(.*) .*/\1/g;s| .*||g')"
# echo "$CommandOutputOnlyPackages" | grep -Fxf - <(echo "$PacmanInstalledList")
# echo "$PacmanInstalledList" | sed -E 's/^(.*)/\/\1 /g' | grep -A1 -Ff - <(echo "$CommandOutput") | grep -v '^--'
# echo "$CommandOutputOnlyPackages"
# PacmanInstalledList=${PacmanInstalledList//$'\n'/ }
